property binding vs interpolation
everything that can be done from interpolation can also be done using the property binding.
Interpolation is actually a shorthand for binding to the #textContent  property of an element
ex-- <h1>{{title}}</h1> --- interpolation
ex-- <h1 [innerText]="title"></h1>--- data binding
